# Interactive HTML Roadbook — spec

Build from `templates/roadbook.html` (a working open-stack skeleton). Only used
when the user asks for a preview / webpage / shareable roadbook; the text plan
stays the source of truth.

## Stack (open only — no proprietary map service)

- **Map**: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles (or any openly-licensed tile source).
  Ship a **static SVG route fallback** so the page still reads with no network.
- **Fonts**: self-host under `assets/fonts/`, load by relative path with
  `font-display: swap`. 霞鹜文楷 Screen (LXGW WenKai Screen, SIL OFL) for body /
  narrative; 更纱黑体 Mono SC (Sarasa Mono SC, SIL OFL) for code, route numbers,
  mileage, altitude, budgets. Fall back to PingFang SC / Hiragino Sans GB for
  reading, and a real mono for digits. Never rely on an online font service.
- **Photos**: only licensed, attributable images (official tourism boards,
  Wikimedia Commons, …). Record photographer, source page, license, and whether
  cropped. Default: place them in `assets/` beside the page for offline use.
  Never scrape someone's travel-page images, never label a stock/AI image as a
  real on-location shot. No usable photo → keep a text section with the place name.

## Section order

目的地的一眼 → 旅程如何展开 → 分日视觉章节 → 当天可操作路书 → 交通住宿预算 →
行前注意与避雷 → 必备清单. Each chapter image carries 1–2 lines tied to that day's
actual action (why start here, how the next leg is en route, when to stop).

## Interactions (all must earn their place)

- Switch by day; clicking a photo/chapter jumps to that day and brings its content
  into view.
- Expand per-leg detail inline; **≥1 real choice** that changes options AND budget
  (e.g. 轻松/充实, 主线/支线) — not decoration.
- Checklist: tickable, shows done/total and remaining, persists locally
  (note clearly if storage is unavailable — ticking still works); "只看未完成" +
  clear-all.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; keyboard operable; text not blocked by images;
  readable with JS off and when printing.

## Visual constraints

- Background `#F6F7F9`; content in `#FFFFFF` rounded cards; accent from the
  destination's natural color. **Forbid** aged-paper tones (`#f5f1e9`, `#eae2d5`)
  and full-square brown 1px newspaper grids.
- Section headers use natural Chinese semantics — no "01 / Title + ALL-CAPS English
  subtitle" stacks. Body text explains routes and trade-offs; no process
  narration ("I didn't treat MBTI as a stereotype") and no internal notes
  ("样式重构"，"字体已修复").
- Chinese headings: `letter-spacing ≥ 0` (0.01–0.03em).
- Money / mileage / altitude use **tabular lining figures**:
  `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums lining-nums`. Budget table keeps the
  `项目说明｜单价 × 数量｜金额` columns even on narrow screens; `¥` and the number sit
  in separate elements, number right-aligned. Totals and post-choice subtotals
  must update together.
- On the user's `备选预案 / 路况提醒` copy: user-facing language, not programmer
  jargon (no "触发 → 动作").

## Data schema (drives templates/roadbook.html)

`trip{title,subtitle,origin,destination,start,end,days,nights,party,currency,budget_total,
budget_includes_longhaul,contingency_pct,mode,route[],hero{src,alt,author,license,source}}` ·
`days[]{n,date,title,lodging_city,drive_km,drive_min,visit_min,meal_min,rest_min,awake_min,
checkpoints[],cost{},waypoints[{name,lat,lon}],photo{src,alt,author,license,source},facts[{text,tag,src}]}` ·
`budget[]{item,unit,qty,amount,category,optional?}` · `checklist[]` ·
`avoid[]{where,wrong,right}` · `sources[]{text,url,date}`. The checker ignores extras;
`optional:true` budget rows are excluded from reconciliation and shown only in 充实版.

## Verify before delivering

- photo ↔ place match; source & license traceable; images actually load
- clicking a photo reaches the right day; cross-day lodging change updates the next day
- budget matches its line items and the interactive choices
- alternates map to real road segments; checklist persists / filters / clears
- test desktop + 320 / 375 / 414 / 768 px: no page-level horizontal scroll; check console
- offline assets complete. State plainly any check you could not run (no browser →
  "视觉、交互、控制台尚未实测"); never summarise unrun checks as "已验证".
